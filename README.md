# CZ4013-Distributed-Systems

## Description
A distributed facility booking system is designed and implemented based on client-server architecture. 
The server program implements a set of services on the facilities for remote access by clients. 
Meanwhile, the client program provides an interface for users to invoke these services. 
On receiving a request input from the user, the client sends the request to the server. 
The server performs the requested service and returns the result to the client. 
The client then presents the result on the console to the user. The client-server communication is carried out using UDP. 

## How to run?
1. Require `Java 8` or higher.

2. Direct to the `communication` folder. Start `Server.java` and `Client.java`.
